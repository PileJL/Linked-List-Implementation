# MATCH N' MONKEY

MATCH N' MONKEY is an Unggoy-Ungguyan inspired card pairing game
that implements linked-list variables
under the console interface of the
Python language. Also, the game
highlight is the battle of wits between
the user and the computer. The first
player to have zero cards is the
winner, while the player with the last
card is the monkey of the game round.
